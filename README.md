# school-base
Trade-school operations system for managing student information, class schedules, and equipment loan.

This application was built for a photography/business
school. Large-group classes had attendance kiosks where students would
scan their ID barcodes to sign in.  The school had a lending library
of photography equipment, which was managed through this system as
well. Many of the features are specific to that school's operations
(e.g. generating class schedules by importing spreadsheet data from
the school admiinistration, or generating e-mailable attendance reports).

_Note: I last worked on this system in 2010. To run it without porting
to modern Django, you'll need a
[version of Django about this old](https://github.com/django/django/tree/babfe78494028415b0e5f74ec2ca9b66506e8d34))._
